# C Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of classic data structures and algorithms implemented in C.

## Data Structures

- Linked Lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Trees
- AVL Trees
- Red-Black Trees
- Hash Tables

## Algorithms

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)

All code is extensively commented and easy to follow.

## Usage

Clone the repository and compile the code using your preferred C compiler. Each data structure or algorithm has its own file containing a `main` function which can be run to demonstrate the functionality.

## Contributing
