# Detailed Explanation of C Code

This C code is a program that simulates a game where a player shoots fruits hanging from a tree. Each fruit has a weight and a hold value, which represents how much force is needed to knock it down. The player shoots at the fruits with a certain power, and if the power is enough to overcome the hold value, the fruit falls into a bucket. The game continues until the bucket is full.

The code uses a binary search tree (BST) to store the fruits, and a stack to store the fruits in the bucket.

## Structs

1. Stack: Represents a stack data structure with the following members:
   - top (int): The index of the top element in the stack.
   - capacity (int): The maximum number of elements the stack can hold.
   - array (int*): Pointer to an array of integers, which stores the elements in the stack.

2. Node: Represents a node in the binary search tree with the following members:
   - value (int): The weight of the fruit.
   - hold (int): The hold value of the fruit.
   - left (Node*): Pointer to the left child node.
   - right (Node*): Pointer to the right node.

## Functions

1. createStack(int capacity): Creates a new stack with the given capacity, initializes its members, and returns a pointer to it.

2. is_empty(Stack *stack): Checks if the given stack is empty, and returns 1 if it is, 0 otherwise.

3. push(Stack *stack, int value): Pushes the given value onto the stack. If the stack is full, it prints "Stack overflow." and returns.

4. pop(Stack *stack): Pops the top element from the stack and returns it. If the stack is empty, it prints "Stack underflow." and returns -1.

5. createNode(int value, int hold): Creates a new BST node with the given value and hold, initializes its members, and returns a pointer to it.

6. insertNode(Node *root, int value, int hold): Inserts a new node with the given value and hold into the BST rooted at the given root. If the value already exists in the tree, the hold is incremented by the given hold.

7. findMinValueNode(Node *root): Finds the node with the minimum value in the BST rooted at the given root, and returns a pointer to it.

8. deleteNode(Node *root, int value): Deletes the node with the given value from the BST rooted at the given root, and returns the root of the modified tree.

9. printInorder(Node *root): Performs an inorder traversal of the BST rooted at the given root, and prints the values and holds of the nodes.

10. main(): The main function of the program, which performs the following steps:
    a. Reads the maximum fruit weight (N) and the number of fruits (M) from the user.
    b. Initializes the BST and the bucket stack.
    c. Inserts M random fruits into the BST, with random weights between 1 and N, and random holds between 1 and N/2.
    d. Prints the initial tree.
    e. Repeatedly reads the fruit value (k) and shot power (p) from the user, updates the BST, and adds the shot fruits to the bucket, until the bucket is full.
    f. Prints the contents of the bucket.

This C code is a program that simulates a game with three wheels (represented by linked lists), each containing a set of numbers. The goal of the game is to find a common number between the three wheels and then rotate the wheels to align the common number at the same position in each wheel.

The code uses singly linked lists to represent the wheels and contains the following struct and functions:

## Struct

1. Node: Represents a node in the singly linked list with the following members:
   - data (int): The value of the node.
   - next (Node*): Pointer to the next node in the list.

## Functions

1. insert(Node **head, int data): Inserts a new node with the given data at the beginning of the list pointed to by head.

2. printList(Node *head): Prints the elements of the list pointed to by head.

3. findCommon(Node *head1, Node *head2, Node *head3, int *pos1, int *pos2, int *pos3): Finds the first common number between the three lists pointed to by head1, head2, and head3, and stores the positions of the common number in the respective lists in pos1, pos2, and pos3. Returns the common number if found, or -1 if not found.

4. rotate(Node **head, int steps): Rotates the list pointed to by head by the given number of steps. If steps is positive, the rotation is clockwise; if steps is negative, the rotation is counterclockwise.

5. main(): The main function of the program, which performs the following steps:
   a. Reads the values of N and M from the user, where N is the maximum number in the wheels and M is the number of elements in each wheel.
   b. Initializes the wheels with random numbers, ensuring that each number (except the common number) appears at most twice across all three wheels.
   c. Rotates the wheels randomly.
   d. Prints the initial state of the wheels.
   e. Finds the common number and its positions in the wheels.
   f. Calculates the number of steps required to align the common number in each wheel.
   g. Rotates the wheels to align the common number.
   h. Prints the final state of the wheels.
   i. Frees the memory allocated for the wheels.

In this program, the wheels are represented as singly linked lists, and the common number is found using a brute-force approach by iterating through all possible combinations of elements from the three lists. The rotation of the wheels is performed by updating the head pointers and connecting the tail of the list to the original head. The program demonstrates the use of linked lists, pointer manipulation, and basic control structures in C.
